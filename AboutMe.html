    In my senior high school days year 2019, I work at the Bureau of Fire Protection Santa Maria Bulacan as an encoder for my work immersion subject. They believe I have strong leadership abilities since they always elect me to be the class president. I can easily communicate, for the reason that I am not shy to approach people. Perhaps I can manage my time effectively, especially when the task is very important and has a deadline. Furthermore, I can easily adapt to a new environment.
